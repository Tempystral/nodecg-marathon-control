## Installation
Navigate to your root NodeCG folder, then run `nodecg install nicnacnic/nodecg-marathon-control`. After the installation is complete, type `nodecg defaultconfig nodecg-marathon-control` to generate the config file.

## Usage
Once you have everything configured in the config, launch your OBS instance, then NodeCG. If everything is configured correctly, NodeCG should connect to OBS and you should be able to control OBS through the dashboard. Graphics in NodeCG are designed to be used with the browser source in OBS.
