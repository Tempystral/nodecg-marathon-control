# nodecg-marathon-control
A NodeCG bundle to control all aspects of a marathon's stream.

**This bundle only uses RTMP for streams, no Twitch!**

Twitch is unreliable, and has the Purple Screen Of Death (which is very annoying!)  
To use RTMP, make sure your server can transcode the stream into [HLS](https://docs.peer5.com/guides/setting-up-hls-live-streaming-server-using-nginx/) and allows [CORS](https://michielkalkman.com/snippets/nginx-cors-open-configuration/)
