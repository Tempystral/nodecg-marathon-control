<h1 style="font-size: 40px;"><b>Welcome!</b></h1>
    <p style="margin-top: -8px; font-size: 18px;">Thank you for installing nodecg-marathon-control! To get started, here are a couple features of the bundle and how to use them.</p>
    <h2>Set Up OBS Preview/Program</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: -5px; font-size: 18px;">Thanks to <a style="color: #2196F3;" href="https://vdo.ninja" target="_blank">VDO.Ninja</a>, the bundle has the ability to show a live feed of the OBS Preview/Program windows! Setting up is easy, in OBS create a windowed projector for both the preview and program windows. Then, on the dashboard, go to Settings > General, press the <i>Setup Preview/Program Window</i> buttons, select the appropiate windowed projector you just created, and BAM!, you can now see what's happening in OBS.</p>
    <h2>Automatically Record All Your Runs</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: -5px; font-size: 18px;">Recording and storing runs has never been easier with Auto Record! It's simple, whenever you're not in an intermission, OBS will always be recording. You can also customize the file name! In the dashboard, go to Settings > Auto Record, turn it on, set your intermission scene, and optionally set your recording file name. Available variables can be shown with the click of a button!</p>
    <h2>Sync Your Races With StreamSync™</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: -5px; font-size: 18px;">Are your races anticlimactic because the commentary isn't synced with the game? With StreamSync™, you don't have to worry about one racer's feed not being synced with the other! Simply click the <i>Sync Streams</i> button in the StreamSync™ panel and all your runner feeds will be synced together. You can also configure StreamSync™ to trigger automatically in Settings > Stream Sync.</p>
    <h2>Automate (Almost) Everything</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: -5px; font-size: 18px;">Make your restreamer's lives easier by automating (almost) everything! With the bundle, you can automatically change the layout in OBS and the stream key based on the current run. This requires additional setup in nodecg-speedcontrol, please view the <a style="color: #2196F3;" href="https://github.com/nicnacnic/nodecg-marathon-control/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> for more information.</p>
